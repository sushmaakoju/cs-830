# CS830: Introduction to AI - Project Repository

## Repository Contents

This repository contains my work for selected assignments from the CS830 Introduction to AI course. The projects demonstrate implementations of various AI concepts and algorithms.

### Highlighted Projects

- **[Assignment 7: Recursive Descent Parser](https://github.com/sushmaakoju/cs830/blob/master/sakoju-a07/code.py)**: A regex-based recursive descent parser implementation for processing logical expressions.

- **Final Project: First Order Logic Implementation**
  - Focused on First Order Logic, Conjunctive Normal Forms (CNFs), Clausal Forms, and Resolution Refutation.
  - Implemented core algorithms for logical reasoning.
  - Project documentation is available upon request later.
  - This project draft is currently being reviewed by experts in Natural Language Understanding.

## Technical Implementation Notes

- The assignments explore various AI techniques including search algorithms, knowledge representation, and logical reasoning
- Implementations follow course requirements while addressing technical challenges
- For Assignment 7, developed a custom parser to handle logical expressions without using external libraries
- The final project provides an original approach to resolution-based theorem proving

## Technologies Used

- Python programming language based on the requirements of each assignment.
- Custom-built parsers for handling logical expressions.
- Implementation of standard AI algorithms with original extensions.

## Academic Context

This work was completed as part of coursework in Computer Science. I mainly focussed on segments more relevant for Natural Language Understanding. The repository showcases technical implementations related to foundations of artificial intelligence.
