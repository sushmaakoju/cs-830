# CS830: Introduction to AI - Project Repository

## Repository Contents

This repository contains my work for selected assignments from the CS830 Introduction to AI course. The projects demonstrate implementations of various AI concepts and algorithms.

### Highlighted Projects

- **[Assignment 7: Recursive Descent Parser](https://github.com/sushmaakoju/cs830/blob/master/sakoju-a07/code.py)**: A regex-based recursive descent parser implementation for processing logical expressions.

- **Final Project: First Order Logic Implementation**
  - Focused on First Order Logic, Conjunctive Normal Forms (CNFs), Clausal Forms, and Resolution Refutation.
  - Implemented core algorithms for logical reasoning.
  - Project documentation is available upon request later.
  - This project draft is currently being reviewed by experts in Natural Language Understanding.

## Technical Implementation Notes

- The assignments explore various AI techniques including search algorithms, knowledge representation, and logical reasoning
- Implementations follow course requirements while addressing technical challenges
- For Assignment 7, developed a custom parser to handle logical expressions without using external libraries
- The final project provides an original approach to resolution-based theorem proving

## Technologies Used

- Python programming language based on the requirements of each assignment.
- Custom-built parsers for handling logical expressions.
- Implementation of standard AI algorithms with original extensions.

## Academic Context

This work was completed as part of coursework in Computer Science. I mainly focussed on segments more relevant for Natural Language Understanding. The repository showcases technical implementations related to foundations of artificial intelligence.

## Academic Challenges Encountered

During the Spring 2025 semester, I faced several obstacles that impacted my coursework:

- Navigated challenges despite having temporary accommodations through Student Accessibility 
  Services (Oct 2024, April 2025).
- Maintained commitment to my chosen PhD specialization in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) amid lot of 
  pressure to change research direction.
- Experienced a challenging academic environment at various levels that tested my resolve to continue in my chosen 
  field of NLU.
- Balanced coursework with teaching assistant responsibilities and academic & research presentations.

**Important Note:** My experiences in this course reflect my personal academic journey. Students considering this or similar courses may wish to consult multiple sources including official course evaluations and peer reviews to form their own expectations.
