# CS830: Introduction to AI - Project Repository

## Repository Contents

This repository contains my work for selected assignments from the CS830 Introduction to AI course. The projects demonstrate implementations of various AI concepts and algorithms.

### Highlighted Projects

- **[Assignment 7: Recursive Descent Parser](https://github.com/sushmaakoju/cs830/blob/master/sakoju-a07/code.py)**: A regex-based recursive descent parser implementation for processing logical expressions.

- **Final Project: First Order Logic Implementation**
  - Focused on First Order Logic, Conjunctive Normal Forms (CNFs), Clausal Forms, and Resolution Refutation.
  - Implemented core algorithms for logical reasoning.
  - Project documentation is available upon request later.
  - This project draft is currently being reviewed by experts in Natural Language Understanding.

### Technical Implementation Notes

- The assignments explore various AI techniques including search algorithms, knowledge representation, and logical reasoning
- Implementations follow course requirements while addressing technical challenges
- For Assignment 7, developed a custom parser to handle logical expressions without using external libraries
- The final project provides an original approach to resolution-based theorem proving

### Technologies Used

- Python programming language based on the requirements of each assignment.
- Custom-built parsers for handling logical expressions.
- Implementation of standard AI algorithms with original extensions.


## Academic Context

This work was completed as part of coursework in Computer Science. I mainly focussed on segments more relevant for Natural Language Understanding even though class is robotics aligned. The repository showcases technical implementations related to foundations of artificial intelligence.

## Academic Challenges Encountered

During the Spring 2025 semester, I faced several obstacles that impacted my coursework:

- Navigated challenges despite having temporary accommodations through Student Accessibility 
  Services and CREO (Oct 2024, April 2025).
- Specifically, unforeseen problems emerged following my guest lecture on AI for Academic Writing during the week of March 3-7, 2025. The subsequent events demonstrate a concerning pattern of inadequate recognition for my intellectual contributions and apparent disregard for my professional trajectory from people who would never recognize an International female scholar. This situation further illustrates the particular challenges that can arise between peers at equivalent stages in a PhD program, where professional courtesy might reasonably be expected but was not consistently maintained. The resort to mischaracterization as a means of academic advancement represents an unfortunate substitution of improper tactics by seeking instant gratification rather than pursuing substantive achievement.  When one maintains clear professional boundaries, mischaracterization often becomes the only available avenue for those seeking to undermine a colleague's standing.
- Maintained commitment to my chosen PhD specialization in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) amid lot of 
  pressure to change research direction.
- Experienced a challenging academic environment at various levels that tested my resolve to continue in my chosen 
  field of NLU.
- Balanced coursework with teaching assistant responsibilities and academic & research presentations.

**Important Note:** My experiences in this course reflect my personal academic journey. Students considering this or similar courses may wish to consult multiple sources including official course evaluations and peer reviews to form their own expectations.

## Professional References and Communications

- This course's robotics focus did not align with my Natural Language Understanding specialization, though I appreciate the educational experience provided.

- The instructor of this class also happens to be Interim department head. I have tremendous gratitude for the same.

- I have not requested recommendation letters from the professor or teaching assistants of this class as part of maintaining appropriate professional boundaries given the specialization mismatch and other contextual factors noted above. **For any authorship verification, forensically verified evidences, please contact me directly at sakoju2014@gmail.com.**

- I maintain the fundamental right to determine my professional associations based on safety considerations and ethical standards. Any attempt to misrepresent this appropriate exercise of professional discretion as something other than a legitimate safety measure constitutes an exploitative mischaracterization of reasonable boundaries.

- All my communications regarding this course have been through official channels only. For verification of this or any other matter related to my academic contribution, please contact me directly at sakoju2014@gmail.com.

- I have not authorized third parties to make inquiries about my performance or contributions in this course to the instructional team.

- I maintain documentation of my actual coursework and contributions. Any characterizations of my work that differ significantly from this documentation may warrant clarification through appropriate academic or legal channels to ensure accurate representation.

### Note about authorship

- For any other confidential information about extenuating circumstances and authorship verification, please contact sakojuj2014@gmail.com for forensically verified AND legally attested copies of admission acceptance letters, enrollment verification as well as timeline of extenuating circumstances.

- These works were from 2018 to 2022. Take it with a pinch of salt as libraries and Language Models underwent evolutionary changes!
